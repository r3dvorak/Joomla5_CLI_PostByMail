## üìå What It Does

This CLI script automatically imports and publishes blog posts from a mailbox (via IMAP) into Joomla 5 as `com_content` articles.

- Processes `text/plain` or `text/html` email bodies
- Detects `MORE:` markers and splits content into intro + full text
- Saves attached images into `images/blog/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Updates all relevant database tables for proper Joomla backend visibility
- Only processes **unread** emails from **approved senders**

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è Example Email Format

SUBJECT: Test Blog 1 (becomes the article title)

EMAIL BODY:
A first paragraph, any length.

MORE: (converted to Joomla's Readmore separator)

Any number of additional paragraphs, any length.

-- NO SIGNATURE! Otherwise it will be included in the article content. --

- Attachment (one image only): `image.jpg` / `photo.webp`
- Allowed formats: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `webp`
- Image will be uploaded to /images/blog/YYYY-MM-DD/

## üïì Cronjob Setup

To automate the import, create a cronjob that runs as your Joomla **web user** (not root!):

```bash
*/5 * * * * web771 /usr/bin/php8.4 /var/www/clients/client221/web771/web/cli/r3dpostbymail.php

‚ùó If run as root, uploaded files/folders may become undeletable in Joomla.
